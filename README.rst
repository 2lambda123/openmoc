OpenMOC Neutral Particle Transport Code
==========================================

Welcome to the OpenMOC repository! OpenMOC is a simulation tool for 
solving for the flux, power distribution, and multiplication factor 
within a nuclear reactor. The code employs the deterministic method 
of characteristics using fixed source iteration. Development of 
OpenMOC began at MIT in 2012 and is spearheaded by several graduate 
students in the `Nuclear Science & Engineering Department`_.

The OpenMOC project project aims to provide a simple-to-use 
Python package for spectral calculations of nuclear reactor 
applications. It includes support for infinite homogeneous
spectral calculations, heterogeneous-homogeneous pin cell
equivalence calculations, as well as constructive solid
geometry and 3D ray tracing for fully heterogeneous
calculations. A basic ENDF-VII continuous energy 
cross-section is provided with support for the user to
make additions to the library for their own applications.
The project started under the Computational Reactor Physics 
Group at MIT.

Complete documentation on the usage of OpenMOC is hosted at 
https://mit-crpg.github.io/OpenMOC/. If you plan to use OpenMOC 
frequently and would like to contribute notes and feedback through 
Evernote, please `contact`_ the development team.
