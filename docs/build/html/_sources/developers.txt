- **Will Boyd** (@wbinventor) is a PhD candidate in MIT's NSE Department working on statistical inference-based acceleration methods for Monte Carlo neutron transport simulations. He has been involved with OpenMOC from the start, with a focus on parallel algorithms for multi-core and GPU platforms.

* **Samuel Shaner** (@samuelshaner) is a PhD candidate in the NSE Department working on time-dependent methods for deterministic and stochastic neutron transport simulations. As part of the initial development team, he worked on implementing coarse mesh finite difference acceleration.

- **Lulu Li** (@lilulu) is a PhD candidate in MIT's NSE Department and has been involved with OpenMOC with her fellow grad students from the start. She developed physics-based multi-grid acceleration methods for OpenMOC, and is currently focusing on solving the 3D MOC problem. 

* **Nathan Gibson** (@ngibson14) has been a member of the OpenMOC development team since the fall of 2013 and is a Ph.D. candidate in the NSE Department at MIT. His research focuses on using ultrafine energy discretization to account for self-shielding effects. He is implementing these methods as well as legacy self-shielding methods into OpenMOC.

- **Robert Sloan** (@varomodt)

* **Prof. Benoit Forget** is Associate Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT. He leads research in a variety of reactor physics topics ranging from deterministic to stochastic methods and is a leading advisor for the OpenMOC development team.

- **Prof. Kord Smith** is the Korea Electric Power Company (KEPCO) Professor of the Practice of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT. He is Chief Scientist for the DOEâ€™s Office of Science, Center for Exascale Simulation of Advanced Reactors (CESAR), and a leading advisor for the OpenMOC development team.
