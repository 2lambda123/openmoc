- **Will Boyd** (@wbinventor) is a PhD candidate in MIT's NSE Department working on statistical inference-based acceleration methods for Monte Carlo neutron transport simulations. He has been involved with OpenMOC from the start, with a focus on parallel algorithms for multi-core and GPU platforms.

* **Samuel Shaner** (@samuelshaner)

- **Lulu Li** (@lilulu) is a PhD candidate in MIT's NSE Department and has been involved with OpenMOC with her fellow grad students from the start. She developed physics-based multi-grid acceleration methods for OpenMOC, and is currently focusing on solving the 3D MOC problem.
